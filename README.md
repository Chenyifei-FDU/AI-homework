# AI-homework

### This repository contains four separate projects written in AI class.
###  
### 
### The first one is search. In this project, I use deep-first search, breadth-first search, uniform-cost search and A* search to implement a Pacman AI agent.
### 
### 
### The second one is CSP(Constraint satisfaction problem). I use Backtracking search and arc consistency algorithm(AC3) to solve N-queen problem.
### 
### 
### The third project is about MDP(Markoff decision process) and Reinforcement Learning.  I write an RL algorithm (feature-based, model free Q-Learning) to implement an agent for the poker game: Black-Jack.
### 
### 
### The forth project is about inference. In this project, I implemented an HMM model to infer the probability of other cars and obstacles. This will help the car to auto-drive, and implemented a particle-filtering algorithm to reduce computing cost.
